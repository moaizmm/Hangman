## Description
A console-based implementation of the classic Hangman game. In this project, a player is prompted to guess letters of a randomly selected word from a predefined list. The goal of this project was to hone Python programming skills, particularly emphasizing object-oriented programming and user interaction.

**Aim of Game**:  
The game prompts the user to input a letter guess. The game ends when the player either correctly guesses the entire word or runs out of lives.

**Project Aim**:  
To put the Python knowledge I have gained into practice by building an interactive game that would encapsulate all the useful infomation and functionalites that I have learnt.

**What I learned**:
- Handling user input and validation.
- Object-Oriented Programming in Python.
- Magic Methods.
- String Manipulation

## Installation
- Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Clone the repository by entering into terminal:
git clone https://github.com/moaizmm/Hangman.git
- Navigate to the project directory via cd Hangman

## Usage
The game can be run via the terminal using:

python3 hangman.py

Follow the on-screen steps to play the game.
